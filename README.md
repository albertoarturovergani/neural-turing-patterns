# neural-turing-patterns
 
There are structures in nature that spontaneously emerge. They were studied for the first time by the
English mathematician Alan Turing (1912 – 1954), who also introduced the concept of the contemporary
computational machine. Examples of those shapes are stripes, spots, grids, tessellations, bubbles, spirals,
foams and waves. In the specific case of this artwork, a collection of Turing patterns are generated via brain
simulations. Each square is a network of neural cells that fire with low (blue), medium (white) and high (red)
intensities. Many of them look very similar, while others are very different. Grouped as they are, pictures
seem to have a graphical continuity with their closest. But, this visual feature is indeed a Gestalt illusion,
because they are completely independent simulation results.
This artwork was awarded at the Aix-Marseille Université’s "Brain and Art prize 2021" competition and
exhibited at the Marseille gallery "Le Pangolin". Moreover, within the "Beautiful mistakes" section, the
artwork won the first prize during the OHBM conference 2022 (Organization of Human Brain Mapping) in
Glasgow, UK (Booklet available at https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0C9SJJQ3D).
